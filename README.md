 ### Daylily Kiousis Profile
 This page is the ultimate culmination of all that I have learned thus far in my education about HTML and CSS. This page also serves to display my past, present, and future work and progress as a junior developer.
 ### Space Hotel Site
 This page is an example site for a business that specializes in hotels, only these hotels take you into space. It is styled using CSS and contains a navbar, image containers, and a form.
 ### Atalko Art 
 This page is still a work in progess as it is for a local artist, however, the outcome will be similar to the styling used in the Space Hotel site.
 ### Movie Theatre Site
 This page is an example home page for a movie theatre style using Bootstrap 4. It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdowns.
